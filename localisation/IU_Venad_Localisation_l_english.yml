 IU_VND_navy_title:0 "Define our Navy"
 IU_VND_navy_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Venad is not known for its navy. Our armies have fended off the swarms of Zamorin and Vijayanagari soldiers time and time again but we could do very little to stop Kollam from being overrun by the Zamorin's fleet. A navy is what is required to find success moving forward, as an army can only do so much when the walls of Kollam itself are being bombarded from afar."
 IU_VND_navy_tt: "If we have a §YNaval Reformer§! advisor or our ruler has the §YEntrepreneur§! or §YNavigator§! trait, Kollam will gain a free §Gshipyard.§!"
 
 IU_VND_maldives_title:0 "A Lucrative Expedition"
 IU_venad_maldives_desc:0 "To the south of Malabar lies the numerous islands of the Maldives. A paradise of beautiful atolls and lagoons, where the water is so clear you can see the ocean floor several hours out from land. The sultanate ruling them was founded by a Somali prince allegedly and the sultan is content to sit on his riches far away from the cauldron of Indian politics. A shame, really. The Maldives are the main source of coir - coconut husk used to build the dhows that so commonly traverse the Indian Ocean. It is used in the design of the ship Kollam and her neighboring cities do - the Uru. An edge in shipbuilding might be what we need against our neighbors to the north, who are more experienced at sea. There is a small fortune of untapped riches in the islands as well, from gemstones to spices and so on. The sultan likely thinks his position secure, too far flung and wealthy to be threatened by annexation. A successful attack on the Maldives may place us on the playing field to be one of the naval powers of India."

 IU_VND_thangasseri_merchants_title:0 "Thangasseri Merchants"
 IU_VND_thangasseri_merchants_desc:0 "Under our careful supervision the ports of Venad have become havens for merchants from all across the globe. This effort is finally beginning to bear fruit as these merchants bring novelties never before seen in Venad. Case in point - the printing press. A quick and easy way to record vital information and cultural heritage. We must expand our Infrastructure however necessary to encourage the sale of these presses more and more."

 IU_VND_defend_venad_title:0 "Trivandrum in Peril"
 IU_VND_defend_venad_desc:0 "Venad has seen many invasions in the past few decades and it is true that our defenses have become worn. Many fear that one more attack from a powerful enemy - say the Vijayanagar empire to our north - could snuff out our ancient country once and for all. We ought to renew our defenses. A fortress in Trivandrum should give us the edge we need to stall against any attackers, then our chieftains can do the rest of the work."

 IU_VND_chieftains_favor_title:0 "The Chieftains' Favor"
 IU_VND_chieftains_favor_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Venad has for centuries had sort of a tribal hierarchy alongside the traditional caste system. This might makes right mindset lends itself to a more meritocratic society than our orthodox Hindu neighbors, but also begets the need for the king to prove himself. While we have not suffered any major defeats, we have not achieved many victories either. The chieftains may resent us if they never see our king leading the army into battle. Their assistance is vital to our well-being, so it is necessary for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to prove his strength."
 vnd_won_battles_with_ruler_tt: "We have won at least §Yfive battles§! with our §Ymonarch§! as general."

 IU_VND_revitalize_kollam_title:0 "Revitalize Kollam"
 IU_VND_revitalize_kollam_desc:0 "Kollam was recently raided by the Zamorin of Calicut and has never truly recovered since. It is a shadow of its former glory, merely a pit stop for merchants who are not allowed in the walls of Calicut. Yet many remember when it was not so. Kollam a thriving hub of traders and scholars alike, the capital of Venad! Oh, to once again have that sort of prestige. We must get to work, growing and nourishing this city. The Zamorin may have overtaken Kollam for a brief moment, but our city is ancient dating back to the Chera dynasty of old and its light will shine through no matter what!"

 IU_VND_erect_new_mandirs_title:0 "Erect New Temples"
 IU_VND_erect_new_mandirs_desc:0 "There is a concern growing of spiritual and moral bankruptcy in Venad. The Ettara Yogam certainly aren't doing a good job maintaining the principles of our faith, but besides the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, there aren't many other places to worship. The people need temples. It reflects well on our king to meet the peoples' needs and the extra tax doesn't hurt, either."

 IU_VND_patronize_temple_title:0 "Adorn the Gilded Temple"
 IU_VND_patronize_temple_desc:0 "For all the thick and thin with the people involved with it, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple is still the crown jewel of Venad. Five stories of solid gold, the richest temple in all of India sees pilgrims from all across the subcontinent. It is named after the aspect of Vishnu, the Preserver, and its custodians are a major faction in the Venad Kingdom. Its importance cannot be understated. We ought to invest into this temple, fill it with treasures and the finest artisanship anyone can find!"

 IU_VND_crucible_of_kerala_title:0 "Crucible of Kerala"
 IU_VND_crucible_of_kerala_desc:0 "There are four powers competing for control of the lucrative Malabar Coast. The decentralized yet fierce naval power of Kolathunad, Calicut, the realm of the conniving Zamorin, the declining city of Kochin, and us of course. Venad is in a prime position to take control of the coast with our superior military, but we are unprepared for an invasion at the moment. We need to be ready when the day comes, so let us bolster our forces and hire new officers!"
 IU_VND_tradition_tt: "We will gain §G3§! §YArmy Tradition§! for each point of §YMIL§! power we make per month, up to §G30§! §YArmy Tradition.§!"

 IU_VND_dethrone_zamorin_title:0 "Dethrone the Zamorin"
 IU_VND_dethrone_zamorin_desc:0 "The Zamorin has lived the life of luxury for far too long now. Calicut has extended influence over the coast for decades, striking deals with Muslim powers to control all the trade and riches flowing through the Coromandel. For our prosperity, we need to dethrone the Zamorin or else he will continue to profit off our stagnation."

 consolidation_of_malabar_title:0 "Consolidation of Malabar"
 consolidation_of_malabar_desc:0 "Now that all of Malabar is conquered, we must integrate the territory to make sure our progress isn't reversed. There are still princes and nobles who would want to weaken Keralam from the inside, and we cannot truly call ourselves the kings of Kerala until any possible rebellions have been nipped in the bud."

 IU_VND_king_of_chiefs_title:0 "A King Among Chiefs"
 IU_VND_king_of_chiefs_desc:0 "It's a pity how these local chieftains squabble for wealth and glory. Their  short-sighted visions do not allow them to see beyond such earthly desires. Our supreme monarch alone has the desire and conviction to lead our nation to glory. It would be a supreme waste of the king's time to convince these local warlords about hsi grand designs. The king's hand must be strengthened so that he can shake off such burdens and focus only on leading our nation forward."

 IU_VND_curtail_ettara_yogam_title:0 "Placate the Nair Castes"
 IU_VND_curtail_ettara_yogam_desc:0 "The warriors and aristocrats from the Nair castes sure do have their uses for the kingdom. However, their desire for power and prestige grow at a rate matched only by their hatred for one another. Thankfully, the rivalries between various Nair families enable us to keep their influence in check and thereby preserve their loyalties to the crown."

 IU_VND_overrun_kochin_title:0 "Overrun Kochin"
 IU_VND_overrun_kochin_desc:0 "Humiliated and shattered, the rulers of Kochin are still pathetically holding on to their past in delusion. It would be merciful to put Kochin out of its misery."

 IU_VND_abolish_the_aristocracy_desc:0 "Let no one be under the false illusion that they are comparable to the monarch, who's rightful place at the helm of our nation has been ordained by the gods themselves. It would be advisable to cut the aristocrats down to size, lest they harbour dreams of parity with the king."

 IU_VND_deal_with_the_devil_title:0 "Deal with the Devil"
 IU_VND_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "Although Vijayanagar threatens us more than anyone else, they do not seem to have it in them to launch a full scale invasion. Our natural jungles and highlands make it not worthwhile for the amount of troops they would lose."

 IU_VND_dynastic_claims_title:0 "Heirs to the Ay"
 IU_VND_dynastic_claims_desc:0 "We are the direct descendants of the Ay kingdom, which itself is derived from the Chera kingdom of antiquity. Through this we have a semi-legitimate claim to the Chera kingdom, and so we seek to expand into the Tamil lands. If we do so, we can legitimize our claim to being Chera and restore the glory of the Tamil kingdoms."

 IU_VND_last_tamil_king_title:0 "Glorified by Heaven"
 IU_VND_last_tamil_king_desc:0 "Finally we have managed to defeat the Pandya dynasty which has oppressed us for centuries! We can now claim to be the Chera dynasty reborn with Tamilakam reconquered and our foes vanquished."

 IU_VND_western_explorers_desc:0 "They come from an alien land and their strange customs and attire seem laughable.

 #Events
 
 IU_VND.1.t: "The Coconut Isles"
 IU_VND.1.d: "In the Maldives are several jungles of coconut trees sprawling the hundreds of islands that make up the archipelago. They are the central production hub for coir, which is used to fabricate the dhows that traverse the Indian Ocean. The crystaline waters of the Maldives shall be the launching pad of our new dominant boat industry. All the sailors of the Indian Ocean will be forced to purchase from us now!"
 IU_VND.1.a: "Our shipwrights are about have a lot of work!"
 
 IU_VND.2.t: "The Three Crowned Rulers"
 IU_VND.2.d: "The Three Crowned Rulers refers to the Tamil kings that reigned centuries ago in southern India. The only true successor to them is the Pandya dynasty which has held on for centuries long than it should have, but we also have an admittedly shaky claim to being descendants of the Chera. It would be prudent to use this claim however we can. Claiming Chera descent may gain us the favor of the Tamils if we are to expand in that direction, and generally give a sense of importance to our kingdom."
 IU_VND.2.a: "Destiny awaits you, fearsome Chera!"
 
 IU_VND.3.t: "Revival of Kollam"
 IU_VND.3.d: "Kollam for the longest time was the capital of the Vel people, and more recently Venad. The seat of the king has shifted to the city of Trivandrum, but Kollam has remained a major port regardless. Now that we have done much to expand the port, talks have broken out about perhaps making Kollam capital once again. This may be an unpopular opinion among our nobles and brahmins seeing as we are changing the status quo once again, but there are advantages to have a bustling port as capital."
 IU_VND.3.a: "Kollam may once again be our shining capital!"
 IU_VND.3.b: "The king's seat must stay in the holy city of Trivandrum."
 
 IU_VND.4.t: "Monasteries of Saint Thomas"
 IU_VND.4.d: "Kochin is home to a large Syriac population which has thrived for centuries. There are churches and synagogues alike filled with gold and holy relics. The Christians and Jews nervously await the policy of their new conqueror - while Kochin has supported them in the past we might not be so merciful. It is up to us, whether to continue to foster these Abrahamic faiths or to label them as bad influences and expel them."
 IU_VND.4.a: "The Syriacs are an important part of the coast's identity and will be protected."
 IU_VND.4.b: "Centuries of untouched relics add up to an impressive fortune of gold..."
 
 IU_VND.5.t: "Elephant Masters of Ceylon"
 IU_VND.5.d: "The island of Ceylon has always been a breeding ground and exporter of war elephants, so having influence over the island does help us in some ways. For one, the elephants themselves are now cheaper to train. Their expertise is the real reward however, and they have made many suggestions for us to use regarding integrating war elephants into the army. This should provide us with a solid advantage going forward."
 IU_VND.5.a: "Their expertise will give us a crucial edge against our foes!"
 
 IU_VND.6.t: "The Rise of Travancore"
 IU_VND.6.d: "There is a rumbling in the court of Venad. For centuries the coalition of nobles and priests have dominated the monarchy, having their way without opposition. Kingmakers in plain sight. Many have stopped taking the monarchy seriously, but one man's ambition might be enough to change that. Marthanda Varma, a member of the Venad dynasty, has declared his goal to transform our kingdom into a modern power with an absolutist king. A notable change from our ancient and frankly tribal ways of rule. This transformation into a new kingdom, Travancore, will take time and most certainly blood. It is a necessity to ensure our survival against the ever greedy European powers, however. With renewed strength, may we be able to protect Kerala from anyone who may set their sights on it!"
 IU_VND.6.a: "We are a bulwark against colonialists!"
 
 IU_VND.7.t: "The Ettuveetil Pillamar Revolt!"
 IU_VND.7.d: "Our efforts to revoke the Ettuveetil Pillamar's special privileges have not gone unnoticed. Quite the opposite - they have taken arms and decided to openly revolt! They have declared their intention to dethrone the king and take more direct control of Venad as punishment for his outrageous attempt at centralizing. We must stop this madness at once!"
 IU_VND.7.a: "Bah! We can handle this."
 
 IU_VND.8.t: "Thambiran Vanakkam"
 IU_VND.8.d: "With the press introduced in Kollam, manuscripts have been printed by Portuguese merchants. It is mostly used for record keeping and messages among European sailors, but recently a full length manuscript was printed in our native Tamil. The Thambiran Vanakkam, although a Catholic script, is the first publication ever in a native Indian language. It is an insignificant work by all means, but the implications for our literary tradition to come are monumental!"
 IU_VND.8.a: "Here's to many more books to come!"
 
 IU_VND.10.t: "Explorers Land in Kollam"
 IU_VND.10.d: "A crowd gathers around the port of Kollam as pale skinned adventurers set foot in our port. It has been an uncountable amount of years since a European ship has docked in India, yet here one is. It is a historic moment for our city. The explorers step off their ships and humbly request our hospitality for the night, then the next day board their vessels and continue on their way. Rumors have spread that this is not the only incident of something like this and sure enough, merchants begin to dock in Kollam, followed by soliders and diplomats! The West has begun to seek allies and trading partners in India, but also their own fortune. We must decide now how Venad will navigate this ever growing conundrum - to work with these merchants or protect ourselves against a future threat?"
 IU_VND.10.a: "Let them stay if they so please. We have much to learn from each other."
 IU_VND.10.b: "Our country has enough troubles as is - these westerners will surely stir the pot."
 
 IU_VND.11.t: "Growth of Trivandrum"
 IU_VND.11.d: "The city of Trivandrum is home to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple but for a long time the temple itself has taken precedent over the city. Lately, people have begun to migrate to Trivandrum though, either to be closer to the temple or simply because trade in the area seems to be growing. It is a natural harbor positioned directly on the route to Bengal and the Malay kingdoms. In the near future, Trivandrum will likely become an urban metropolis."
 IU_VND.11.a: "The growth of our cities is always a welcome sight."
 
 IU_VND_westernizing_tt: "We will cooperate with western countries, but if we fall behind in technology they may seek a more direct relationship with us than trade!"
 IU_VND_not_westernizing_tt: "We will restrict trade with the west, but this may draw their ire once they begin proper expansion in Asia!"
 
 IU_EURO.1.t: "The Game of India"
 IU_EURO.1.d: "Our explorers in search of spices, incense, and other such riches have charted the coast of India for the very first time. India is a massive subcontinent with hundreds of kingdoms with ancient feuds and alliances alike, not unlike our home in Europe. Several princes have already noticed our ships off the coast, either wanting to establish trade deals, align with us against their sworn enemies, or even make sure we have no place in the subcontinent. Friends and foes alike, we must exploit these conflicts in India to expand our fortune!"
 IU_EURO.1.a: "The die is cast."
 IU_indian_influence_tt: "Our Colonial Influence determines the amount of sway we have over the kingdoms in India and Indochina. Our influence will increase over time, but it can be sped up by forming alliances or subject relationships with Indian and Southeast Asian countries, owning trade companies in these regions, and establishing forts and trade factories in these countries. The influence can then be expended to add a country to your sphere of influence, effectively making them an autonomous subject under your protection. Countries in your sphere will allow you military access and free reign to establish trade posts."

But in an all too common situation they have more say in Venad politics than the monarchy itself. They are aligned with the Ettara Yogam, the custodians of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and attempt to dictate what the king can and cannot do. Although the king has the loyalties of his personal army and the wavering loyalty of the chieftains the nobility remains an existential problem for a king seeking to exert authority."

The term is more specifically associated with warrior castes in Venad, and the markers of one of the Nair in Venad are unmistakable. These disciplined soldiers - never without a weapon by their side - and strikingly beautiful women of the Nair castes are a source of pride for Kerala. This and their habit of marrying into the Brahmins puts them into a seat of power in the Venad kingdom. The monarch will have his work cut out for him if he wishes to uproot these ancient systems."

 VND_one: "Ties with Vijayanagar"
 VND_one_desc: "Like it or not, our lifeline for the past several decades has been the sprawling kingdom of Vijayanagar. From the border of Gujarat to the Palk Strait, they control a massive swath of Dravidam. We have become very good at giving them the answers they want, and this skill can extend into other interactions as well."
 VND_two: "Tribal Cavalry"
 VND_two_desc: "The Ay tribes have always been fundamental in our army composition. Venad is known for its fierce horsemen which have carried us to victory against much larger opponents. Encouraging this practice to continue is without question a good idea."
 VND_three: "Merchants of Kollam"
 VND_three_desc: "Kollam is traditionally one of the great cities of the Malabar coast. Although not as powerful as it was in its heyday, it still sees a fair bit of business. It is strong enough to the point where an ambitious king could invest into it so that it once again is the foremost power in Kerala. But for now, we are content with what trade we get."
 VND_four: "Western Infrastructure"
 VND_four_desc: "The presence of westerners is a hot topic all across the continent of Asia. Some reject them saying that trade with them is a slippery slope inevitably leading to conquest. We however disagree. Western trade has always provided us with benefits and a shrewd alliance with a naval power is a good step towards asserting supremacy over Kerala."
 VND_five: "Fund the Padmanabhaswamy Temple"
 VND_five_desc: "The Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a grand beacon of Vishnu worship which has pilgrims from all across the Dharmic world. It is the richest temple in India, made from solid gold. We could stand to benefit from patronizing this temple and reaping some of its business for ourselves."
 VND_six: "Syriac Patronage"
 VND_six_desc: "Venad has always been tolerant of other religions - especially compared to some of our neighbors to the north. There is a large Syriac diaspora in Malabar, the lot of which reside in Kochin but a number live in Trivandrum and Kollam. There is no reason not to accommodate for them, as their unique skills and viewpoints can be beneficial as a whole."
 VND_seven: "First Standing Army of Kerala"
 VND_seven_desc: "Venad is a warlike state first and foremost. This is how it has always been - and thus we ought to take the initiative to establish a standing army. None of our neighbors will be ready as India is still amok with armies made from tribes, mercenaries and the like."
