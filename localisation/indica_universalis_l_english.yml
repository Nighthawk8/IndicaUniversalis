INDICA_UNIVERSALIS_DESC:0 "The year is 1444, a pivotal moment for the four kingdoms of Malabar. Koluthunad, in the north, struggles greatly with its decentralised government, rampant piracy, and the meanacing Zamorin to its south, but these struggles can easily be turned into opportunities. Calicut, under its influential Zamorin, grows ever stronger as a regional power, looking to overtake its rival Venad. Kochin having been driven south and routed by the Zamorin, looks to recover from this great loss, with its diverse population and strategic location providing great opportunities for growth. Finally, Venad, the principal power in the region and home to the majestic Padmanabhaswamy Temple, looks to subdue all others and expand into Tamil territory. Who will you choose to lead into the future? Who will emerge victorious from the crucible of Kerala?"

 IU_nair_aristocracy: "Nair Aristocracy"
 IU_nair_aristocracy_desc: "The Nair are a group of castes prevalent in Kerala society, doubly so in that of Venad. The term is more specifically associated with warrior castes in Venad, and the markers of one of the Nair in Venad are unmistakable. These disciplined soldiers - never without a weapon by their side - and strikingly beautiful women of the Nair castes are a source of pride for Kerala. This and their habit of marrying into the Brahmins puts them into a seat of power in the Venad kingdom. The monarch will have his work cut out for him if he wishes to uproot these ancient systems."
